                My name is Jonas

            <p>
                In 2010, I took my first web design course through microCamp. 
                Unfortunately, because I was very young and didn't understand how 
                the world of work works, I ended up giving up my career as a programmer.
                But I remembre with enthusiasm the hours I spent in front of the computer 
                playing with Adobe Fireworks and Dreamweaver. Today, these tools are out
                of use, and the job market has evolved. Now, at 29 years old, with enough
                maturity to better understand reality, I realize that I have the talent and 
                ability to become a great programmer!. I regret not pursuing my career, but 
                now I am determined to move forward and achieve my goals
