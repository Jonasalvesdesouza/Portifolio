                As a financial analyst, I have developed advanced analytical skills and experience in interpreting complex data for strategic decision-making. Now, I am seeking a transition to a full-stack developer role to apply my problem-solving ability creatively, developing comprehensive web applications. I am focused on acquiring knowledge in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and databases to create efficient and scalable solutions, combining data analysis with software development o positively impact project outcomes.
